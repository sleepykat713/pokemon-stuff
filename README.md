# pokemon-stuff
A place to put Pokemon-related data.

This repository will primarily contain Pokemon CSV files and similar data.

I own no part of the data I have collected herein. All data - such as Pokemon names, base stat totals, etc. - were collected from publicly-available game data. I have merely arranged the collected data into a spreadsheet for personal research purposes.

Any CSV or other file I post here is free to use under the same licensing as any other Pokemon data.
